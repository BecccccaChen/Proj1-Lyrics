\subsection{General picture: How do people feel when they listen
music?}\label{general-picture-how-do-people-feel-when-they-listen-music}}

The Lyrics classifies all songs into 12 categories: \emph{Rock},
\emph{Pop}, \emph{Metal}, \emph{Hip-Hop}, \emph{Country}, \emph{Jazz},
\emph{Not Available}, \emph{Electronic}, \emph{R\&B}, \emph{Indie},
\emph{Folk} and \emph{Other}. In order to get a general sense of 12
categories play, a frequency distribution analysis and setiment analysis
will be performed in this part.

\subsubsection{Frequency distribution of the 12
categories}\label{frequency-distribution-of-the-12-categories}}

Among the 12 categories, I'm wondering how the frequencies are
distributed. In other words, which category appears with most times and
which is the least.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Proj1_Lyrics_HW_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-3-1} \end{center}

The ranking shows that \emph{Rock}, \emph{Pop} and \emph{Metal} are top
3 categories of songs which means that these 3 kinds of songs are most
popular.

\hypertarget{sentiment-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Sentiment Analysis}\label{sentiment-analysis}}

By inducting a sentiment analysis using \emph{syuzhet} package, I want
to investigate whether emotions vary with the categories.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{Proj1_Lyrics_HW_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-4-1} \end{center}

The percentage barplot suggests that there actually exists a variation
in emotion between categories. Notice that \emph{Metal}, \emph{Hip-Hop}
and \emph{Rock} have higher negative score than others. Concidering
about the frequency distribution, \emph{Metal}, \emph{Hip-Hop} and
\emph{Rock} stand at the top 4 categories which complicates that people
have more interesting on songs with negative attitude.

\#\#Do people's preferences for music change over time? Having obtained
a basic knowledge of the emotion of different kinds of songs. Let's take
a deeper look into people's preferences for music changed over time. I
will explore the emotion trend by decades.

We can see, the line of negative songs has increasing trend and the line
of positive song has decreasing trend. In other words, people were more
likely to listen positive songs than negative songs in 1970s. However,
as time goes on, more and more people prefer negative songs.

\#\#Summary * \emph{Rock}, \emph{Pop} and \emph{Metal} are top 3
categories of songs that people like to listen. Lyrics of \emph{Rock}
and \emph{Metal} have extremely negative attitude which means people
prefer to listen negative songs.\\
* In 1970s, people prefered positive songs than negative songs, but as
time goes on, the trend has been changed.\\
* Musically and lyrically, so-called negative songs just explore a part
of life that is there, and I suspect will always be there. Overall, I
don't think that the negative song is totally bad, simply that it covers
areas that occur in life and can either suggest a resolution, or simply
be a way of saying that this ``negative'' thing occurred and the
feelings can resonate with other people on a specific level. Nowadays
people live under more and more pressure. Maybe listening negative songs
is a good way to deal with stress.
